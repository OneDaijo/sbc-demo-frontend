React app that utilizes webpack.

To do anything locally with this, be sure to run `npm i` first.

Dev Mode: run `npm start`.  This will start the webpack dev server, running on port 8080.  Visit localhost:8080 to view the local version of the app.

Prod: run `npm build-prod`.  This will run webpack, building the code into a bundle found in the `dist` folder.  All code will be transpiled to ES5.
